# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett Hackard is a company with thousands of employees, many of which are nearing the age of retirement. The company plans to provide a retirement package to eligible employees. The company must also prepare for thousands of employees leaving their positions within the next few years. To prepare for the future vacancies, we have been assigned to analyze employee data in order to determine: 1) who will be retiring within the next few years 2) the number of positions that will need to be filled. The company has provided several tables of employee data, including each employee's name, position, department and birth date. Using SQL, this data can be organized and filtered in order to complete the previously mentioned tasks.

## The Dataset

The data consists of six csv files. To visualize the structure of this data, an entity relationship diagram (ERD) was created, as seen below. The department number and employee number are the data that connect all of these tables to each other.
